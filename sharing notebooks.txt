The easiest way to share your notebook is simply using the notebook file (.ipynb), but for those who don't use Jupyter, you have a few options:
Convert notebooks to html file using the File > Download as > HTML Menu option.
Share your notebook file with gists or on github, both of which render the notebooks. See this example. 
If you upload your notebook to a github repository, you can use the handy mybinder service to allow someone half an hour of interactive Jupyter access to your repository.
Setup your own system with jupyterhub, this is very handy when you organize mini-course or workshop and don't have time to care about students machines.
Store your notebook e.g. in dropbox and put the link to nbviewer. nbviewer will render the notebook from whichever source you host it.
Use the File > Download as > PDF menu to save your notebook as a PDF. If you're going this route, I highly recommend reading Julius Schulz's excellent article Making publication ready Python notebooks.
Create a blog using Pelican from your Jupyter notebooks.
